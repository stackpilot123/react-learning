--> why to learn react?
-> makes easy to manage and build complex frontend 
         compile
--> React-------> html,css,js 
-> browser ko toh sirf htm css js he samaj aata hai

--> why react was created ?
-> no consistency in ui 
-> state was handled by js -> state maanlo ek variable hai jo change ho sakhta hai jab koi event occur hoga 
-> ui -> DOM 
--> so there was no sync between the dom and the state -> react solves this issue

-> choti moti websites mai react use karne ka matlab nahi hai -> 1 btn ke click hone pe 4-5 jagah jab chezze badle toh react use karne ka asli matlab hai


--> react is a library .
-> library vs framework -> in framework flow is defined , for eg-> how you will name the file and all -> library gives us tools to work by myself
-> angular is a framework -> also single page 


TOPICS TO LEARN
==========================
